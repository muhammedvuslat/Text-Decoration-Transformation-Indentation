Hello
welcome to my repo
I am happy to share my work with you in my software developer adventure, which I am still in the development phase.
In this work, I have experienced the compatibility of html and .css files. 
I tried to use CSS Padding, CSS Properties for Texts, Font Families, Link Properties as much as possible.
Thank you for your interest.
Happy codes
